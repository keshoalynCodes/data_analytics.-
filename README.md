This Python code performs text analysis on the UN declaration of Human Rights text data to identify the most pertinent terms in the document. It generates a word cloud and a bar plot of the top 25 frequent terms.

Stopwords: The code checks if the stopwords package from NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is available. Stopwords are common words that are typically excluded from text analysis because they don't carry significant meaning. If the package is not available, it downloads it.

Reading the File: The code reads the contents of the UN declaration of Human Rights text data file. Make sure to provide the correct file path to the text data file on your local machine.

Splitting the Words: The text data is split into individual words, which will be used for further analysis.

Filtering Stopwords: A set of stopwords in English is created. Stopwords such as "the," "is," and "and" are commonly excluded from text analysis. The code filters out these stopwords from the list of words.

Counting Word Frequency: The code counts the frequency of each word in the filtered list of words.

Generating Word Cloud: Using the word frequencies, a word cloud is generated. A word cloud is a visual representation of word frequencies, where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency.

Displaying the Word Cloud: The generated word cloud is displayed using the matplotlib library. The word cloud image is shown, omitting axes and other visual elements.
